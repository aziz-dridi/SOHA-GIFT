        <p>You've always been strong, whether you've known it or not. Hard-headed and strong-willed. You've bobbed and weaved through the stresses life has thrown at you, always taking in stride whatever has come your way. But you're tired, and I know you are. It's okay, little one. You can rest now. Lay your head on Daddy's shoulder, and just close your eyes. Breathe, and let the calmness wash over you. Let those big girl thoughts slip away with life's stresses as you sink deeper into my arms.

            I know you're afraid of being judged. It's okay to feel that way. We all do, sometimes. But you're safe here. Daddy isn't going to judge you, and it's just you and me, little one. I know you need a break, and you deserve one. You deserve time away from having to pretend to be a big girl all day every day. This is a safe space for you to just relax and be your truest self, to be Daddy's little girl just like you want so badly to be. It's okay to be vulnerable here.
            
            Daddy's got you, now. He's here to lift you up, even when it feels like the whole world wants to tear you down. I know it's not always easy, letting go. It can be hard to open yourself up so completely to someone, especially when it comes to something like regressing. I know you feel shame and embarrassment, and I'm not here to tell you it's wrong to feel those things. No, in fact, I'm here to tell you the opposite. I'm here to tell you it's okay to feel whatever it is that you feel, that those feelings are normal and natural. You don't need to run from them. When they pop up in your little mind, simply observe them, accept them for what they are, fleeting moments of doubt, and then let them pass just as easily as they arrived.
            
            You are allowed to feel shame and embarrassment, but you don't need to, you don't deserve to. You aren't broken, no matter how much shattered glass you have to look through to see the truth of yourself. You're just you. All-encompassing and beautiful you. You don't need to be anything more, and you certainly aren't anything less. I know there are people who wouldn't understand. We don't live in a perfect world, after all. But those people aren't here right now. It's just you and me, remember? You're Daddy's girl, and he's going to hold you and keep you safe as long as you need. There's no rush. You don't need to be grown up right now. You're allowed to be little.
            
            Your being little, it isn't a weakness. It isn't something you need to hide from everyone. You get to choose who you let in, because this is a strength. You are strong. You have a way of dealing with the stress that comes your way, a healthy and cathartic method of adjusting to life's unpleasantness, and that just allows you to see its beauty all the more vibrantly. You get to look at the world and see it in full color, from the perspective of innocence untainted by the world's bleakness. That could never be a weakness, little one. It is part of the source that keeps you going, something to draw upon when you need it. Something that's always there for you, just like Daddy is here with you now.
            
            You trust Daddy, enough to let him in, and Daddy trusts you in return. We understand each other, you and I. And that level of trust, understanding, and respect is what you deserve from your caregiver. You deserve to let loose and just be yourself without fear that you will fall without someone being there to catch you. You're balancing yourself, and Daddy's there with you, right behind you, keeping you steady. And you keep Daddy steady as well. You give him something to support, something to direct his focus to. Being your caregiver comes naturally, and it is just as rewarding and fulfilling to be your Daddy as it is for you to be my baby. You keep Daddy centered, little one.
            
            We get to explore this together, you and I. We get to find comfort and strength in one another, and your regression is at the heart of it all. So go ahead, be little. Fall into Daddy's arms and know that he'll be there to catch you. And know that while you're in those arms, nothing will come to harm you. Daddy wants to see you learn and grow, he wants to help you become the best little version of yourself you can possibly be. But Daddy also accepts you as you are right now, little one. And he always will. </p>
